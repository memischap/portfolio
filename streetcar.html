<h2>Why it’s time for Vancouver to turn up the streetcar rhetoric </h2>

  Skytrain is the backbone of Vancouver’s transit system. 60 years ago, a different type of train connected neighbourhoods and commuters in our city. Streetcars were an essential part of Vancouver’s history and development. The City of Vancouver has been dreaming about a Streetcar revival since the 1990s, but the plan has never gone far. Translink will soon be drafting their 30 year transit plan to guide the future of transit. A well-designed streetcar system could promote higher density and increase jobs and services and ultimately bring more people closer to quality transit. The City needs to take action because transit projects don’t build themselves.
</p>
<p>
	The modern streetcar renaissance started with the Portland Streetcar project in 2001. The City of Portland claims the streetcar has prompted the construction of 7,400  housing units of which 2,911 are affordable units. Other American cities hoping to spark similar levels of development have jumped to build streetcars. Surface Rail (i.e LRT and streetcars) are more connected to the community it serves as streetcar stops can be built into the curb. Skytrain stations are either buried in the ground or up in the air and are disconnected from the streets they serve. Running the streetcar down Broadway and 10th could help to build ‘complete streets’ in our city. Complete streets are critically important to the future of a livable Vancouver because they offer spaces for all types of transportation (car, cycling, transit, walking) and for the streets to become a living part of the communities they connect.
</p>
<p>
	The City of Vancouver has been planning a modern streetcar project since the 1990s. A range of studies and business cases have been explored. Vancouver has set aside land and built a number of streets to be streetcar ready. A new study will be looking at the feasibility and costs of creating a False Creek to Downtown streetcar network. This study will update the 2004 study that considered a streetcar connecting Granville Island to Waterfront station via the Olympic village. These preliminary designs offer advantages over Portland’s system, envisioning the Streetcar running in its own lanes offering huge speed and reliability advantages.
</p>
<p>
	The Streetcar plans have been mentioned in area plans for decades but have never been given priority. With an uncertain timeframe the City of Vancouver can’t commit to designing streetcar oriented streets when construction may be decades away. The new plans underway for South False Creek and North East False Creek attempt to accommodate the potential of a streetcar.
	Having the streetcar project in the plans can help inform planning in areas adjacent to the lines. Getting the streetcar in before the mid 2030’s means it could help Vancouver reach its 2040 goal of having 2/3 of trips taken by walking, biking or transit.
</p>
<p>
	The difference between Light Rail (LRT) and Streetcar varies from City to City. Both can use the same style train and offer ground level rail transportation. LRT usually always gets its own lane or operates in portions in a tunnel or an elevated route like skytrain. Streetcars are more flexible and can run in dedicated lanes, medians or mixed with traffic. How fast, efficient and expensive the transit is comes down to design and construction not the labels we apply. Vancouver’s network could operate like LRT in spots and switch to fit the needs of the community it serves.
	Streetcars can provide efficient transit outside of the False Creek and Downtown areas. In a 2012 study looking at rapid transit to UBC a Light Rail plus tunnelled Skytrain route ranked among the best options. The Millenium line extension of the Skytrain is already approved. The Light Rail portion of the plan linking UBC to the Arbutus Skytrain station would continue onto the False Creek streetcar route. This would also connect with the newly minted plans for the Arbutus corridor streetcar.
</p>
<p>
	Vancouverites need to voice their opinion to Translink to ensure that their money is well spent. I think we should focus on creating a new transit network stretching from UBC to downtown rather than just another stub of Skytrain. A streetcar network will help connect the West End, False Creek Flats and Downtown Eastside to the West Side. If you live near False Creek, or want to see Kits have rapid transit that connects to streets, shops and existing homes, let Translink know during the upcoming consultation for the 30 year transit vision.
