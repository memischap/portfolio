        <h6>Project summary</h6>
          <p>Connect fort was a large scale public blanket fort designed to be a inclusive space for people to meet and connect. We tested and debuted the design at a one day pop-up as part of the <a href="http://www.citystudiovancouver.com" target="_blank" class="link">CityStudio</a> and Viva Vancouver event Bridge Warming and saw over 400 guests come through. After our event I designed the   <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yyRKo8_yoGTphBe8MYuUJAvomqU-kFob" class="link" target="_blank">poster</a>
            and
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z2CDjx2vqXKhLwboCRet4PnpMTWSZIJW" class="link" target="_blank"> report </a> for the project. </p>
            <h6>The problem</h6>
            <p>At Citystudio Vancouver you are challenged to take problems and issues facing Vancouver that are close to your heart. Alyssa Quan, Riley McLeod, Olivia Hui and Myself teamed up to create a space where community members could gather during dark winter evenings.</p>
              <h6>Background research</h6>
              <p>We started looking around at what others had done in the space of public space events, and tried to find out why we all were drawn to gathering as a theme. We then started contacting stockholders in the community such as the Vancouver Police Department and neighbourhood association to get their feedback. </p>
              <h6>Initial ideas</h6>
              <p>Our initial ideas were a Blanket Fort, a campfire spot, and a hot chocolate social. These ideas all incorporated a draw and reason to stay.</p>
              <h6>Iterations</h6>
              <p>The actual fire concept was quickly deemed a logistical nightmare, and the heart of the hot chocolate idea didnâ€™t align with our zero waste goals. We began to focus in on what could be inside a blanket fort and how it could serve the community. This lead to looking at different layouts for space and physical forms.</p>
              <h6>Final form </h6>
              <p>Our final form was a roughly 450 square foot blanket fort, comprised of 3 borrowed pop-up tent frames and several dozen donated blankets sewn into a custom cover. Inside we served hot chocolate, while people could sit around our faux fire, or play with the lego or different games we provide. We collected bags of donations for union gospel mission as a way to ensure our project was supporting not just the people in it but other who are struggling in the winter. I was responsible for the layout and structural design of the fort, along with graphic design and signage.</p>
              <h6>Main take aways</h6>
              <p>Connect Fort was an absolutely inspirational project. Every piece of feedback from community members was positive. I learned a lot about working with other stakeholders and aligning your goals to thrive together. It also was great experience doing design and fabrication and realization of a project. </p>
